Add the spinach and stir in the cream, season with salt, freshly ground black pepper and a little grated nutmeg. Cook the spinach, stirring occasionally, until the cream has thickened, 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning to your taste.\r\n\r\nFold each slice of ham or prosciutto in half and line the nonstick cups with 1 slice of meat each. Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the cooked spinach into each of the cups, then crack an egg into each, making sure it stays whole (hint - if you're worried about breaking the egg yolk, crack the egg into a small bowl first, then pour it into the muffin cup). Season the tops of the eggs with salt and freshly ground black pepper and bake in the oven until set, about 15 minutes. Allow the baked eggs to cool in the muffin cups for a couple of minutes before removing them from the pan. Serve immediately.\r\n\r\nRecipe courtesy of Rachael Ray\r\n\r\nRead more at: http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/rachael-ray\/green-eggs-and-ham-recipe.html?oc=linkback","created_at":"2015-09-14 12:12:16","updated_at":"2015-09-14 12:12:16"},{"id":"4","title":"salmon fillets","ingredients":"Four 5-ounce center-cut salmon fillets (about 1-inch thick)\r\n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice\r\n3 tablespoons olive oil\r\nKosher salt\r\n1 bunch kale, ribs removed, leaves very thinly sliced (about 6 cups)\r\n1\/4 cup dates\r\n1 Honeycrisp apple\r\n1\/4 cup finely grated pecorino\r\n3 tablespoons toasted slivered almonds\r\nFreshly ground black pepper\r\n4 whole wheat dinner rolls\r\n\r\nRead more at: http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/food-network-kitchens\/pan-seared-salmon-with-kale-and-apple-salad-recipe.html?oc=linkback\r\n\r\nRead more at: http:\/\/www.foodnetwork.com\/recipes\/rachael-ray\/green-eggs-and-ham-recipe.html?oc=linkback","body":"Bring the salmon to room temperature 10 minutes before cooking.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, whisk together the lemon juice, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil and 1\/4 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.
