                <h2>How do I change my password?</h2>
                <p>The password change option can be accessed in the <strong><a href="#">"Account"</a></strong> section of the                   website. You will need to know your current password to access this feature.</p>
                <h2>How can I recover a lost password?</h2>
                <p>A lost password requires access to the email you registered with the HeartSmart account. You can start simply by             clicking "Recover Password" in the Account section of the webiste.</p>

                <h2>Where can I save and track my stats?</h2>
                <p>You can save and track your stats, progress, and calculator responses under a registered HeartSmart account.                 Remember to confirm your registration by clicking the validation link sent to your email after registering (the link             will disappear after 48 hours).</p>
                <h2>I can't find the validation link.</h2>
                There may be a few reasons behind this. Check your spam folder. If it's not there, request another validation link              here. Finally, double check that you registered the correct email in the Account section after logging in.


                <h2>Where can I learn more about Cardiovascular Disease?</h2>

                <h2>Is there a mobile application available for HeartSmart users?</h2>
                <p>An Android and iPhone mobile app containing the core features (stat tracking, calculators, tools etc.) is currently under development.</p>
